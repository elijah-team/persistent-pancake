# Elijah programming language/system 

**Elijjah** is a high-level language suitable for replacement of C/C++ and Java.

### Goals (for fluffy-umbrella)

* To constantly drive the code toward an expression of the domain rather than an expression of the programming
   language-specific expression of that domain.

### Goals (for Elijah the Project)

* Integrate into current C and Java projects. Piecemeal replacement down to the function level.

* Notebook/Code manager along the lines of Jupyter and Unison.

* Some strange tribute as well to Glamarous Tooklit.

### Goals (for Elijah the Language)

* Mainly not to have to learn Kotlin.

## Status

Much work is needed.
