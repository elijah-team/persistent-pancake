# Elijah programming language/system

**Elijjah** is a high-level language suitable for replacement of C/C++ and Java.  (And of course any other
language in existence or non-existence, except [FORTRAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karrueche_Tran)
and [NULL](http://jdurrett.ba.ttu.edu/misc/Null-language.html).)

Just so you know, dear reader, most of the problems this problems tries (or is designed to solve) are
already solved; and the rest are being worked on by people wearing much better smelling cologne than I.

### Mandatory FSF blurb

This is free software intended for on all systems, including GNU/Linux.

### Goals (for fluffy-umbrella)

1. To constantly drive the code toward an expression of the domain rather than an expression of the programming
   language-specific expression of that domain.
2. [World domination](#world-domination)

### World domination

1. Linus Torvalds
2. The Brain

### Goals (for Elijah)

* Mainly not to have to learn Kotlin.

* Integrate into current C and Java projects. Piecemeal replacement down to the function level.

* Notebook/Code manager along the lines of Jupyter and Unison.

* Some strange tribute as well to Glamarous Tooklit.

## Status

The repo is currently buildable from maven. You can also import into Eclipse and IDEA
and get up and running. The tests need to run run from the root directory, which is
done automatically in maven but not IDEA.

Much work is needed.
