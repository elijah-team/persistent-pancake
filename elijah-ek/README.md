(EK) Expert System
===================

- Original somewhere (Easy enough to find if you care)

## TODO

- Do some testing (property, fuzz)
- Ditto. (Might be good for formal; don't know which one yet)
- Improve interfaces
  * `char` (64K not 256 -- what do you actually need?)
  * Add another interface for some things (that I will expound later)

- Integrate into parent project more (a lot)
- Great for codegen
  * Gave up on apt
  * Try Xtend
